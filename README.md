# [Lean 4 Gists](https://github.com/ChemistMikeLam/Lean4Gists)

This repository contains code that document my explorations in [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4).

The contents of this repo are probably not very interesting to anyone else. Also, a lot of the things here are probably already in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).
If you are trying to look for a useful library, you should probably look somewhere else.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project, but given its aims I am obviously not accepting contributions here.

If you have suggestions, you could open an issue, but there is no gaurantee that I would do anything about it.
